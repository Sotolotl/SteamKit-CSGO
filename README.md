# SteamKit-CSGO
[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/SteamKit-CSGO.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SteamKit-CSGO/)

A library build on top of [SteamKit2](https://github.com/SteamRE/SteamKit) for communicating with the CSGO Game Coordinator.

Heavily inspired and based on Joshua Ferrara's [node-csgo](https://github.com/joshuaferrara/node-csgo)

Documentation coming soon!
